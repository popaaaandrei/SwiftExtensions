# SwiftExtensions
most used extensions for Foundation &amp; UIKit

Here I have added my collection of working extensions to usual Foundation & UIKit classes. You can find here the usual stuff, working & compiling under Swift 3.

Most of them are my work, some of them have been collected from various sources which I lost track of. Don't worry, nothing proprietary.

XOXO,
Andrei
